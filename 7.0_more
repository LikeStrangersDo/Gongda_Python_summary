some good practice while using Python:


1> create new environment: conda env create -f environment
2> address package dependencies: recursive testing
3> share evironment with collegues: keep record of project packages using YAML file
4> version control: Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket
5> containerize/orchestration production codes: Docker, Kubernetes
