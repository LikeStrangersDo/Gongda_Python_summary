## Python for research in atmospheric chemistry

## Contents
My notes are provided as a handy reference. They are not necessarily the best or only solutions to your reseach needs.

0. Introduction to Python
1. Numerical computation
2. Pandas dataframes
3. Data visualisation
4. Handling NetCDF files
5. Advanced Python knowledge
6. Other Python usages

## Python tutorials
For learning Python, I recommend the tutorials below. They provide datasets with the codes, so you can run the codes and see the results from each step. For GEOS-Chem users, I particularly recommend the GEOS-Chem Python tutorial by Jiawei Zhuang. It gets you working with Python immediately.

0. Python Data Science Handbook: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/
1. IPython Cookbook: https://ipython-books.github.io/
2. GEOS-Chem Python: https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial

## Core packages
 Here I list some of the Python packages frequently used in our research. For any package, user guides are always available on its homepage. You can browse the "Examples" or "Gallery" to see the main applications of a package. You can also find the full user guide in "Documentation".

0. Numpy: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
1. Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide
2. Xarray: http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html
3. Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/index.html#
4. Cartopy: https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html 

## Suggestions for beginners
After knowing some basics, jump to Numpy and Pandas directly. Ignore anything irrelevant, see suggestions from [Jiawei Zhuang (author of GEOS-Chem Python)](https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial#how-to-learn-python). You will be able to use Python in your research very soon! If you encounter any problems/bugs/errors, just Google them. It is very likely that you can find solutions online, particularly on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/.

You can use [Python IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) to help you edit and manage your codes: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/),[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/), and many others exist. You can also decide not to use any of them.
