## Python for research in atmospheric chemistry
My notes focus on usages related to our research (data analysis and visualisations). They are based on my knowlege of Python, so they are not necessarily the best or only solutions to your research needs, there are numerous Python usages that I do not know. 

My notes are organised as follows:

0. Python basics
1. Numerical computation
2. Pandas dataframes
3. Data visualisation
4. Handling NetCDF files
5. Advanced Python knowledge
6. Other Python usages

## Python tutorials
To learn Python for research computing, I recommend [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) and [IPython Cookbook](https://ipython-books.github.io/). For GEOS-Chem users, I strongly recommend the [Python/xarray tutorial for GEOS-Chem users](https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial) by Jiawei Zhuang, and the [GCPy package](https://github.com/geoschem/gcpy) provided by GEOS-Chem team. 

## Suggestions for beginners
Python is widely used in our field, you should be able to resolve all your research computing problems with it. [It has a few advantanges over other programming languages in our field](https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial#why-python). Python is also particularly smart in handling NetCDF files which are freqently used in our research. There is a very large Python user community so that you can easily seek support. Just Google your problems/bugs/errors, it is likely that you can find existing solutions online, particularly on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 

To learn Python, I suggest you to jump to Numpy and Pandas right after knowing some Python basics. Ignore anything irrelevant, then you should be able to use Python in your research very soon! Also see suggestions from [Jiawei Zhuang](https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial#how-to-learn-python). You can use [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) to help you edit and maintain your codes: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/), and many others. You can also decide not to use any of them. You can use Python interactively, or you can submit Python jobs via complete scripts.
