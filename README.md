6. Other Python usages

## Tutorials
My notes here are more about quick references, and they are not necessarily the best or the only solutions to your specific problems. For learning Python, I recommend the tutorials below. They provide datasets with the codes, so you can run the codes and see the results from each step. For GEOS-Chem users, I particularly recommend the GEOS-Chem Python tutorial by Jiawei Zhuang. It gets you working with Python immediately.

0. Python Data Science Handbook: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/
1. IPython Cookbook: https://ipython-books.github.io/
2. GEOS-Chem Python: https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial

## User guides 
For any Python package, a user guide is always available and provides complete introduction to the package. You can browse the "Examples" or "Gallery" to see the main applications of a package. And you can also use keywords to jump to what is helpful. Here I list the user guides to some of the core packages used in our research:

0. Numpy: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
1. Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide
2. Xarray: http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html
3. Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/index.html
4. Cartopy: https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html 

## Suggestions for beginners
After knowing some basics, jump to Numpy and Pandas directly. Ignore anything irrelevant, see suggestions from [Jiawei Zhuang (author of GEOS-Chem Python)](https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial#how-to-learn-python). You will be able to use Python in your research very soon! If you encounter any problems/bugs/errors, just Google them. It is very likely that you can find solutions online, particularly on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/.

You can use [Python IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) to help you edit and manage your codes: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/),[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/), and many others exist. You can also decide not to use any of them.
