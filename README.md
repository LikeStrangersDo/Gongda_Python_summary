4. Handling NetCDF files
5. Other Python usages in research
6. More advanced Python knowledge

## Tutorials
My notes here are more like cheatsheets for you to quickly find references or exsiting solutions to some problems in research. For learning Python, I recommend the tutorials below. You may find them more helpful than my notes, as they provide datasets with the codes, so you can actually run the codes and see the results of each step. For GEOS-Chem users, I particularly recommend the GEOS-Chem Python tutorial by Jiawei Zhuang. It gets you working with Python immediately.

0. Python Data Science Handbook: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/
1. IPython Cookbook: https://ipython-books.github.io/
2. GEOS-Chem Python: https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial

## Official guides 
Offical guides provide complete introduction to the packages. And normally you can just search for keywords to jump to what is helpful. You can also browse the "Examples" or "Gallery" to see the main applications of the package. Here I list some of the core packages used in research:

0. Numpy: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
1. Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide
2. Xarray: http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html
3. Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/index.html
4. Cartopy: https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html 

## Suggestions for beginners
After knowing some basics, jump to Numpy and Pandas directly. Then you will be able to use Python in your research very soon! See suggestions from [Jiawei Zhuang (author of GEOS-Chem Python)](https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial#how-to-learn-python). For questions that you can not solve, you can always find solutions online, particularly on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/.
You can use [Python IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) to help you edit and manage your codes: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/),[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/), and many others. You can also go on without any of them.
