# Python for research computing in atmospheric sciences

## Contents
0. Introduction to Python
1. Numerical computing
2. Pandas dataframes
3. Data visualisation
4. Handling NetCDF files
5. Other Python usages in research
6. More advanced Python knowledge

## Suggestions for beginners
After knowing some basics, jump to Numpy and Pandas directly. Then you will be able to use Python in your research very soon! Ignore anything irrelevant, see suggestions from [Jiawei Zhuang (author of GEOS-Chem Python)](https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial#how-to-learn-python).


## Tutorials
Besides my notes here, I recommend the tutorials below. For a GEOS-Chem user, I particularly recommend the excellent GEOS-Chem Python tutorial by Jiawei Zhuang. Because it sticks to research computing, and uses examples from daily GEOS-Chem analysis.

0. Python Data Science Handbook: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/
1. IPython Cookbook: https://ipython-books.github.io/
2. GEOS-Chem Python: https://github.com/geoschem/GEOSChem-python-tutorial

## Official guides 
Offical guides are complete introduction to the packages. And normally you can just search for certain keywords to jump to what is helpful. Or you can browse the "Examples" or "Gallery" to see the main applications of the package.
